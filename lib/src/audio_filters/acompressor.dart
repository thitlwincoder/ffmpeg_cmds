/// A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal. Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to improve the overall loudness. Itâ€™s done to get the highest attention of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track. If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead" afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect but can also destroy a track completely). The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.
///
/// Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level [threshold] and dividing it by the factor set with [ratio].
/// So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB.
/// Because an exact manipulation of the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over the time.
/// This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
/// [attack] determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold before any reduction will occur and [release] sets the time the signal has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
/// Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched. The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the [makeup] setting.
/// So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the source.
/// To gain a softer entry in the compression the [knee] flattens the hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.
