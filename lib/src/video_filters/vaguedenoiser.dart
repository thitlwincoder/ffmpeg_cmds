/// It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain, using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after. Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and reduced noise, without blurring picture features.
